Perforce scripts

p4status.py
Reports how the local file system state differs in comparison to the repository state
* Reports files that are missing from your computer
* Reports files open for edit
* Reports files open for add
* Reports files loose files unknown to the server (at #have)
* '--clean' utility deletes files loose files from the file system
* '--added' modifier to clean that also reverts and deletes files open for add
* '--edited' modifier to clean that also reverts files open for edit

p4top.py
Much like unix/linux 'top': uses the monitor table to report server activity

p4verify.py
Verifies the contents of local files to ensure they contain the proper data (the contents the server expects)
* Reports corrupted files
* '--repair' utility will force sync corrupted file to #have (files open for edit shouldn't be lost, but YMMV!)
