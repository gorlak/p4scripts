Perforce scripts

p4status.py
Reports how the local file system state differs in comparison to the repository state
* Reports files that are missing from your computer
* Reports files open for edit
* Reports files open for add
* Reports files unknown to the server (extra files, and in consideration to #have...)
* '--clean' utility to sync local state to match the server's state (add missing, revert edited/added, delete extra)
* '--repair' utility will force sync corrupted file to #have (files open for edit shouldn't be lost, but YMMV!)

p4top.py
Much like unix/linux 'top': uses the monitor table to report server activity
